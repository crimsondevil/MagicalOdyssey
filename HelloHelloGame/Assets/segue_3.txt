Harry:	Well, you can believe whatever you want... but it won't change the reality.

Harry:	Oh no, not this again. You are such a sore loser! You just can't accept your defeat, can you?

Harry:	Fine! If this will get you to a stop, then okay. Let's just get over with it. And maybe then, finally, you'll stop bragging about your house and quit your vain challenges...

Pansy:	Well you won't even get a chance to win this time! So be prepared for your annihilation, Noobie.
