Pansy:	Zip it, noobie!

Harry:	You got any problem with me Parkinson? Admit it, you are just jealous because we've won the most number of house cups in all these years.

Pansy:	You'll never be better than me.

Harry:	Oh yeah, who's in the lead, this year also?

Pansy:	Yeah well, we'll make it up and beat you guys in no time. How about a one-on-one Quidditch Match? You and me, right now!

Harry:	Umm, have you gone insane, Pansy?

Pansy:	Why, what's the matter? Are you scared that you might lose and bring shame to your house, huh?
x
Harry:	Okay! Let's settle this once and for all, which house is better.

Pansy:	Okay then. See you at the Quidditch Pitch, tomorrow at dawn!
